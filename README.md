# Case Study Explanation of the Finance Agentic AI System

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates a prototype **agentic AI system for Finance**. The system automates key invoice-to-pay processes including invoice validation, compliance checks, payment scheduling, and cash-flow forecasting. The workflow is executed by multiple specialized AI agents coordinated by a supervisory agent, with clear audit trails and reporting.

## Agent Roles

1. **AP Agent**

   * Matches invoices against purchase orders and received goods.
   * Identifies discrepancies and applies a 5% tolerance for acceptable variances.
   * Recommends outcomes: *Approve*, *Hold*, or *Needs Review*.

2. **Compliance Agent**

   * Reviews vendor risk factors such as sanctions/PEP checks, country risk, policy adherence, and recent bank detail changes.
   * Flags non-compliance or high-risk scenarios.

3. **Payment Agent**

   * Determines optimal payment timing.
   * Balances invoice due dates with projected liquidity.
   * Recommends approval or deferral based on a liquidity buffer (e.g., >\$200,000).

4. **Forecasting Agent**

   * Updates cash-flow forecasts to incorporate approved, held, or deferred payments.
   * Provides Treasury with an updated view of liquidity.

5. **Supervisor Agent**

   * Coordinates across agents and resolves conflicting recommendations.
   * Enforces governance thresholds:

     * Invoice value ≥ \$25,000 → Human review.
     * Vendor risk score > 7 → Human review.
     * Agent confidence < 0.7 → Human review.

6. **Workflow Engine (LangGraph)**

   * Implements a structured flow:
     **Start → Invoice validation → Compliance check → Payment scheduling → Forecast update → Supervisor decision → Human review (if applicable) → Finalization**

## Data Model

The system operates on structured records:

* **Invoices**: ID, vendor, amount, currency, due date, line items.
* **Purchase Orders**: Items, quantities, unit prices, totals.
* **Vendors**: Risk ratings, bank details, payment terms, change history.
* **Messages/Decisions**: Each agent’s recommendations, reasoning, and confidence scores.

A **mock data generator** is included to simulate realistic test cases.

## Test Scenarios

The notebook evaluates the system against multiple scenarios:

* **Clean match** – invoice fully aligns with PO and goods receipt.
* **PO mismatch** – discrepancies beyond tolerance.
* **High-value invoice** – triggers supervisory human escalation.
* **Recent bank change** – prompts compliance scrutiny.
* **High-risk vendor** – triggers policy-based escalation.

Each case is processed end-to-end with logs of decisions and rationale.

## Outputs

The system delivers:

1. **Final decisions**: Approve, Reject, Hold, or Human Review.
2. **Decision logs**: Explanation and supporting evidence for each step.
3. **Operational metrics**: Processing time, agent confidence levels, human-intervention rate.
4. **Reports and dashboards**:

   * Executive KPIs (approval rate, intervention rate, average processing time).
   * Agent performance analysis.
   * Business impact (discount capture, liquidity buffer adherence).
   * Exception analysis and optimization opportunities.
   * Exportable HTML analytics report for stakeholders.

Additionally, a **real-time monitoring simulation** highlights anomalies such as rising hold rates, error rates >5%, or excessive reliance on human intervention.

## Business Value

* **Efficiency**: Enables straight-through processing of low-risk invoices.
* **Risk reduction**: Consistent enforcement of compliance checks.
* **Liquidity optimization**: Aligns payment timing with cash-flow management.
* **Governance**: Maintains escalation thresholds and full auditability.
* **Transparency**: Provides KPIs, exception reports, and monitoring alerts.

## Implementation Considerations

* **Integration**: Connect to ERP/AP systems, vendor master data, sanctions screening, and treasury tools.
* **Policy calibration**: Adjust thresholds and tolerances to organizational governance frameworks.
* **Human-in-the-loop**: Ensure escalated cases route to appropriate approvers.
* **Security**: Enforce strict controls on vendor bank detail changes.
* **Continuous improvement**: Monitor KPIs and adjust workflows for improved performance.

## Summary

This notebook provides a structured prototype of an **agent-based accounts payable automation system**. It validates invoices, enforces compliance, schedules payments based on liquidity forecasts, and supervises decisions with clear escalation rules. The implementation demonstrates auditability, governance alignment, and measurable business outcomes.
